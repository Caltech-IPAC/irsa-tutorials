    "Euclid is a European Space Agency (ESA) space mission with NASA participation, to study the geometry and nature of the dark Universe.\n",
    "The Quick Data Release 1 (Q1) are the first data release from the Euclid mission after the Early Release Observations (ERO).\n",
    "On March 19, 2025 the data will be available on the [ESA archive](https://easidr.esac.esa.int/sas/) and on the [IRSA archive](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu).\n",
    "\n",
    "These Q1 notebooks focus on how to access, download, and process Euclid Q1 data from the IRSA archive.\n",
    "If you have any issues accessing data from the archives, please contact the helpdesk directly: [IRSA helpdesk](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/help_desk.html) and [ESA Euclid Helpdesk](https://support.cosmos.esa.int/euclid).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Euclid Wide Survey standard operating mode, the telescope undertakes a 4-point dither pattern.\n",
    "At each position VIS and NISP each take a 570s exposure, consisting of a direct visible image and a red grism exposure.\n",
    "This is followed by further NISP exposures in the Y, J, and H band filters (112 seconds each).\n",
    "The telescope is then dithered, and the sequence is repeated starting with a different grism position angle.\n",
    "There are actually two operational grisms oriented 180 degrees from each other. Each grism which will be used twice in this sequence, but with slight angular offsets (+/- 4 degrees), effectively creating the four different grism angles (Scaramella et al. 2022, A&A 662, A112).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data which can be obtained for SIR include: SIR \"images\", which effectively show the full image of objects with the spectral traces overlapping, and SIR 1D spectra for individual objects.\n",
    "In this notebook we describe how to access and process the 1D spectra products.\n",
    "For most users, simply accessing th 1D spectra is probably the preferred option, unless they would like to extract the spectrum again, or inspect the images to see if there is any artifact which might add noise to the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to the SIR 1D spectra released as part of Euclid Q1.\n",
    "Other Euclid notebooks show how to use other data products released as part of Euclid Q1."
