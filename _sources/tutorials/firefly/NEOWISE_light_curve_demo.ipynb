    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to plot light curves from NEOWISE data while also flaunting the many useful capabilities of the Firefly Python API. Using the 'Known Solar System Object Possible Association List' catalog from the NEOWISE-R database, we can easily compose a light curve of the faint asteroid `558 Carmen` and show its observed positions in the sky solely through the `firefly_client` package. Minor planet light curves are important in determining their size, spectral class, rotation period and many other properties.\n",

    "Firefly is an astronomical data access and visualization written by Caltech/IPAC-IRSA. The visualization provides user with an integrated experience with brushing and linking capabilities among images, catalogs, and plots. Firefly is used in IRSA GUIs to query and visualize data from missions such as WISE, Spitzer, SOFIA, ZTF, PTF, etc. and a large number of highly-used contributed data products from a diverse set of astrophysics projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two ways to initialize a Firefly client from Python, depending on whether you're running the notebook in JupyterLab or not. Assuming you have `jupyter-firefly-extensions` set up in your environment as explained [here](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/jupyter_firefly_extensions/blob/master/README.md), you can use `make_lab_client()` in JupyterLab, which will open the Firefly viewer in a new tab within the Lab. Otherwise, you can use `make_client()` in a Jupyter Notebook (or even a Python shell), which will open the Firefly viewer in a new web browser tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need a Firefly server to communicate with your Firefly Python client. In this notebook, we use a public Firefly server: the IRSA Viewer (https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/irsaviewer). However, you can also run a local Firefly server via a [Firefly Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipac/firefly) and access it at `http://localhost:8080/firefly`. The URL of the Firefly server is read by both `make_client()` and `make_lab_client()` through the environment variable `FIREFLY_URL`. However, `make_client()` also allows you to pass the URL directly as the `url` parameter."
