    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to plot light curves from NEOWISE data while also flaunting the many useful capabilities of the Firefly Python API. Using the 'Known Solar System Object Possible Association List' catalog from the NEOWISE-R database, we can easily compose a light curve of the faint asteroid `558 Carmen` and show its observed positions in the sky solely through the `firefly_client` package. Minor planet light curves are important in determining their size, spectral class, rotation period and many other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firefly is an astronomical data access and visualization written by Caltech/IPAC-IRSA. The visualization provides user with an integrated experience with brushing and linking capabilities among images, catalogs, and plots. Firefly is used in IRSA GUIs to query and visualize data from missions such as WISE, Spitzer, SOFIA, ZTF, PTF, etc. and a large number of highly-used contributed data products from a diverse set of astrophysics projects.\n",

    "The `firefly_client` package provides a lightweight client class that includes a Python interface to Fireflyâ€™s Javascript API.\n",
