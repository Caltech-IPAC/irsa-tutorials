    "This notebook loads light curves from the\n",
    "[NEOWISE](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/wise.html) Single-exposure Source Table\n",
    "for a sample of about 2000 cataclysmic variables from [Downes et al. (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1086/320802).\n",
    "The NEOWISE Single-exposure Source Table is a very large catalog -- 10 years and 40 terabytes in total\n",
    "with 145 columns and 200 billion rows.\n",
    "When searching this catalog, it is important to consider the requirements of your use case and\n",
    "the format of this dataset.\n",
    "This notebook applies the techniques developed in\n",
    "[Strategies to Efficiently Work with NEOWISE Single-exposure Source Table in Parquet](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/notebooks/neowise-source-table-strategies.html).\n",
    "This is a fully-worked example that demonstrates the important steps, but note that this is a\n",
    "relatively small use case for the Parquet version of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific strategy we employ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a cone search radius that determines which NEOWISE source detections to associate\n",
    "  with each target.\n",
    "- Load the sample of CV targets.\n",
    "- Calculate the indexes of all HEALPix order k=5 pixels within the radius of each target.\n",
    "  These are the dataset partitions that need to be searched.\n",
    "- Parallelize over the partitions using `multiprocessing.Pool`.\n",
    "  For each pixel:\n",
    "  - Construct a dataset filter for NEOWISE sources in the vicinity of the targets in the partition.\n",
    "  - Load data, applying the filter. In our case, the number of rows loaded will be fairly small.\n",
    "  - Do a cone search to match sources with targets in the partition.\n",
    "  - Return the results.\n",
    "- Concatenate the cone search results, groupby target ID, and sort by time to construct the light curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of this method will increase with the number of rows needed from each partition.\n",
    "For example, a cone search radius of 1 arcsec will require about 10 CPUs, 65G RAM, and\n",
    "50 minutes to load the data from all 10 NEOWISE years.\n",
    "Increasing the radius to 10 arcsec will return about 2.5x more rows using roughly the same resources.\n",
    "Increasing the target sample size can result in similar efficiency gains.\n",
    "To try out this notebook with fewer resources, use a subset of NEOWISE years.\n",
    "Using one year is expected to require about 5 CPUs, 20G RAM, and 10 minutes.\n",
    "These estimates are based on testing in science platform environments.\n",
    "Your numbers will vary based on many factors including compute power, bandwidth, and physical distance from the data."
