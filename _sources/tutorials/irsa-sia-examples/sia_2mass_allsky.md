# Image Thumbnails from 2MASS All-Sky Atlas

This notebook tutorial demonstrates the process of querying IRSA's Simple Image Access (SIA) service for the 2MASS All-Sky Atlas, making a cutout image (thumbnail), and displaying the cutout.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

* Learn how to search the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatory Directory web portal for a service that provides access to IRSA's 2MASS images.
* Use the Python pyvo package to identify which of IRSA's 2MASS images cover a specified coordinate.
* Download one of the identified images.
* Create and display a cutout of the downloaded image.

## Introduction

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) project uniformly scanned the entire sky in three near-infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources brighter than about 1 mJy in each band, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 10. More information about 2MASS can be found at:

https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/2mass.html

The [NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu) at Caltech is the archive for 2MASS images and catalogs. The 2MASS images that are the subject of this tutorial are made accessible via the [International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)](https://ivoa.net) [Simple Image Access (SIA)](https://wiki.ivoa.net/internal/IVOA/SiaInterface/SIA-V2-Analysis.pdf) protocol. IRSA's 2MASS SIA service is registered in the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatory (NAVO) [Directory](https://vao.stsci.edu). Based on the registered information, the Python package [pyvo](https://pyvo.readthedocs.io) can be used to query the 2MASS SIA service for a list of images that meet specified criteria, and standard Python libraries can be used to download and manipulate the images.
Other datasets at IRSA are available through other SIA services:

## Imports

- *pyvo* for querying IRSA's 2MASS SIA service
- *astropy.coordinates* for defining coordinates
- *astropy.nddata* for creating an image cutout
- *astropy.wcs* for interpreting the World Coordinate System header keywords of a fits file
- *astropy.units* for attaching units to numbers passed to the SIA service
- *matplotlib.pyplot* for plotting
- *astropy.utils.data* for downloading files
- *astropy.io* to manipulate FITS files

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pyvo as vo
from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
from astropy.nddata import Cutout2D
from astropy.wcs import WCS
import astropy.units as u
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from astropy.utils.data import download_file
from astropy.io import fits
```

## Section 1 - Setup

+++

Set images to display in the notebook

```{code-cell} ipython3
%matplotlib inline
```

Define coordinates of a bright star

```{code-cell} ipython3
ra = 314.30417
dec = 77.595559
pos = SkyCoord(ra=ra, dec=dec, unit='deg')
```

## Section 2 - Lookup and define a service for 2MASS images

+++

Start at STScI VAO Registry at https://vao.stsci.edu/keyword-search/

Limit by Publisher "NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive" and Capability Type "Simple Image Access Protocol" then search on "2MASS"

Locate the SIA URL https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/2MASS/IM/nph-im_sia?type=at&ds=asky&

```{code-cell} ipython3
twomass_service = vo.dal.SIAService("https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/2MASS/IM/nph-im_sia?type=at&ds=asky&")
```

## Section 3 - Search the service

+++

Search for images covering within 1 arcsecond of the star

```{code-cell} ipython3
im_table = twomass_service.search(pos=pos, size=1.0*u.arcsec)
```

Examine the table of images that is returned

```{code-cell} ipython3
im_table.to_table()
```

## Section 4 - Locate and download an image of interest

+++

Locate the first H-band image and display its URL

```{code-cell} ipython3
for i in range(len(im_table)):
    if im_table[i]['band'] == 'H':
        break
print(im_table[i].getdataurl())
```

Download the image and open it in Astropy

```{code-cell} ipython3
fname = download_file(im_table[i].getdataurl(), cache=True)
image1 = fits.open(fname)
```

## Section 5 - Extract a cutout and plot it

```{code-cell} ipython3
wcs = WCS(image1[0].header)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cutout = Cutout2D(image1[0].data, pos, (60, 60), wcs=wcs)
wcs = cutout.wcs
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure()

ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=wcs)
ax.imshow(cutout.data, cmap='gray_r', origin='lower', 
          vmax = 1000)
ax.scatter(ra, dec, transform=ax.get_transform('fk5'), s=500, edgecolor='red', facecolor='none')
```

## Exercise

+++

Repeat the steps above to retrieve a cutout from the AllWISE Atlas images

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
