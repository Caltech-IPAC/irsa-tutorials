# Simulated Data Tutorial Notebooks

IRSA hosts a diverse collection of simulated astronomical datasets spanning multiple missions and science domains; designed to support survey planning, algorithm development, and scientific exploration.
Because this collection is heterogeneous in coverage, structure, and intended use, simulated products are released with detailed documentation and tailored access methods.
These tutorials are designed to help users get started with accessing, visualizing, and analyzing simulated datasets hosted at IRSA.

- [Roman HLSS Number Density](roman_hlss_number_density.md) - Illustrates how to query the catalog and derive galaxy number density.
  
- [OpenUniverse2024 Roman coadds](openuniverse2024_roman_simlated_wideareasurvey.md) - Accesses OpenUniverse2024 wide-area simulated survey data.

- [OpenUniverse2024 Visualization](OpenUniverse2024Preview_Firefly.md) - Uses Firefly to get an overview of survey structure and visualize content.

- [OpenUniverse2024 Time Domain](openuniverse2024_roman_simulated_timedomainsurvey.md) - Demonstrates how to access and analyze time-domain survey.

- [CosmoDC2 Data Access](cosmoDC2_TAP_access.md) - Demonstrates how to access, query, and visualize the catalog.
