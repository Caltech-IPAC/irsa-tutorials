# Simulated Data Tutorial Notebooks

IRSA hosts a diverse collection of simulated astronomical datasets spanning multiple missions and science domains; designed to support survey planning, algorithm development, and scientific exploration.
Because this collection is heterogeneous in coverage, structure, and intended use, the simulated products are released with detailed documentation. 
Access methods are tailored to the structure and scale of each product.
These tutorials are designed to help users get started with accessing, visualizing, and analyzing simulated datasets hosted at IRSA.
