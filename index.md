# Caltech/IPAC--IRSA Python Notebook Tutorials


These Python Jupyter Notebook tutorials demonstrate access methods and techniques for working with data served by the [NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu).
They cover topics like querying IRSA, working with catalogs in Parquet format, visualizing with Firefly, and general other techniques.


## Accessing IRSA's on-premises holdings using VO protocols



## Accessing IRSA's cloud holdings

These notebooks demonstrate how to access the IRSA-curated datasets that available in Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 cloud storage buckets.



## Accessing Euclid data


## Accessing SPHEREx data


## Interactive visualization in Python with Firefly

These notebooks demonstrate how to use the Firefly visualization tools from Python.
[Firefly](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly) is an open-source toolkit based on IVOA standards and designed to enable astronomical data archive access, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

It is used in archive user interfaces at [IRSA](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu), the [NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI)](https://nexsci.caltech.edu/), the [NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/), and the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/).



## Simulated Data



## Generally useful techniques

These notebooks  cover miscellaneous topics that users might find useful in their analysis of IRSA-curated data.
