IRSA Tutorials
==============

Notebooks developed to demonstrate IRSA use cases.

We do use MyST Markdown format for the notebooks, please visit [the upstream documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/md-vs-ipynb) to learn more about the reasoning behind the choice. 
However, we add it here that you can easily have the same user experience in JupyterLab if these two dependencies are installed:
 - [jupytext library](https://pypi.org/project/jupytext/)
 - [jupyterlab-myst JupyterLab extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-myst/)
